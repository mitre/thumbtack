Thumbtack
=========

Thumbtack is a `Flask`_ powered web front-end providing a REST-ful API to mount and unmount forensic disk images, built on top of the |imagemounter|_ library.
It supports the mounting of many `disk image file types`_, depending on which supporting libraries are installed.

.. note::

    Though imagemounter will work on any Unix- or Linux-based OS that has support for the underlying mounting utilities, only the Ubuntu Linux distribution has been used to test Thumbtack.

.. warning::

    Due to the user restrictions of most disk-mounting utilities, you will have more success with Thumbtack when it is run as root.
    For more information on deploying Flask applications, please refer to Flask's `deployment documentation`_.

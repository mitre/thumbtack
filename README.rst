thumbtack
=========

Thumbtack is a web front-end providing a REST-ful API to mount and unmount
forensic disk images, built on top of the |imagemounter|_ library.

Documentation is available in the ``docs/`` directory or online at
https://thumbtack.readthedocs.io/en/latest.

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install thumbtack
    $ sudo imount --check # List install status of tools used by imagemounter
    The following commands are used by imagemounter internally. Without most commands, imagemounter works perfectly fine, but may lack some detection or mounting capabilities.
    -- Mounting base disk images (at least one required, first three recommended) --
    MISSING   xmount              needed for several types of disk images, part of the xmount package
    MISSING   ewfmount            needed for EWF images (partially covered by xmount), part of the ewf-tools package
    MISSING   affuse              needed for AFF images (partially covered by xmount), part of the afflib-tools package
    MISSING   vmware-mount        needed for VMWare disks
    MISSING   mountavfs           needed for compressed disk images, part of the avfs package
    MISSING   qemu-nbd            needed for Qcow2 images, part of the qemu-utils package
    ...
    

Install additional tools needed to mount your images. More information can be found in the imagemounter installation docs https://imagemounter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.


.. code-block:: bash

    # Install tools
    $ sudo apt-get install xmount ewf-tools afflib-tools sleuthkit
    $ cd path/to/disk/image/files
    $ sudo thumbtack
